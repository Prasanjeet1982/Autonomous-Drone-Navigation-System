# FastAPI Drone Control App

This is a simple FastAPI-based web interface for controlling a drone using the DJITelloPy library. The interface provides endpoints for taking off, landing, and moving the drone forward.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the drone control application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (optional)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-drone-control.git
   cd fastapi-drone-control
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the drone control interface.

### Docker Support (Optional)

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```
   docker build -t my-drone-control-app .
   ```

2. Run a Docker container:

   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 my-drone-control-app
   ```

3. Access the drone control interface at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
